# PyBer_Analysis
**Overview of the analysis:**

- The purpose of the new analysis is to create a new data frame summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and creating multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type while using Pandas and Matplotlib. City type such as Urban, Suburban and Rural, we are comparing those three to showcase how they differ in total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver.





**Results:**

Urban City Type has generated more profit compared with Suburban and Rural with the total of $39,854.38 with total rides of 1,625 and total drivers of 2,405. Suburban city type was the second city type that generated profit of $19,356.33 with the total rides of 625 and total drivers of 490. Rural came last in the list with profit of $4327.93 with the total rides of 125 and total drivers of 78. However, Rural has the highest Average Fare of per ride of $34.62 and Average Fare per driver of $55.49 compare with Urban average fare per ride and driver of $24.53 and $16.57.

**Summary:** 

The following three recommendation are:

- To increase the number of drivers in Rural and Suburban due to the fact that the average fare per ride and driver is a lot higher compare to Urban city type. 

- To promote more and do some marketing to Suburban and Rural city type, to get more customer to use Pyber service and therefore generate more profit.

- The Average fare per driver and per ride has a huge difference between Urban and Rural/Suburban. 

  if we can cut the cost of fare per driver and bring it down to the same as Urban by doing that Pyber can use the extra budget in marketing.
